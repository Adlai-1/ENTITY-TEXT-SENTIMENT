**ðŸ“Š Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis with LSTM**

Efficiently analyze sentiments in entity-level text using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 

This project employs advanced natural language processing techniques to predict sentiment behind entities mentioned in textual data.

**ðŸš€ Key Features**

LSTM Model: Leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent nueral networks for accurate sentiment predictions.

Entity-Level Analysis: Focus on sentiments associated with specific entities within the text.

CLI Frontend: Command-Line Interface included for user-friendly interaction.

**ðŸ”§ Usage**
