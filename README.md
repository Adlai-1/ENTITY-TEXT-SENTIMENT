# About
* Efficiently analyze sentiments in entity-level text using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 
* This project employs advanced natural language processing techniques to predict sentiment behind entities mentioned in textual data.

# Key Features
* LSTM Model: Leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent nueral networks for accurate sentiment predictions.
* Entity-Level Analysis: Focus on sentiments associated with specific entities within the text.
* CLI Frontend: Command-Line Interface included for user-friendly interaction.

# Tech Stack
* Python.
* Tensorflow.
* Pandas.
* Sci-kit learn.
* LSTM.

# Installation
* Clone the repository.
* Install dependencies using requirements.txt (i.e. pip install -r requirements.txt).
* Use the CLI for seamless interaction with the sentiment analysis model.
* Explore additional information about the data preprocessing, model development, model training, evaluation and testing stage in the model.ipynb file.

# Results
* Achieved an accuracy score of 86.17% on testing datasets.

# Documentation
* Comprehensive documentations through comments have been made in order to make intuition simple.

# CLI Usage
* Execute ./CLI.py --help to access the full documentation on the flags available with this CLI.
* Execute ./CLI.py to run the text-sentiment CLI.
